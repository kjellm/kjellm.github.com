This is a series of articles that give a brief introduction to several
topics that come up when working with database systems. My motivation
is to shed light upon topics that I see many software developers are
ignorant of.

The articles will hopefully give the reader enough information to make
her curious on the topic, and I will provide references as an aid for
further studies.

### The articles so far (alphabetically)

- <a href="MissingValuesInSQL.html">Missing values in SQL</a>
- <a href="NaturalVsSurrogatePrimaryKeys.html">Natural vs surrogate primary keys</a>
