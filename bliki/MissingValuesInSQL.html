%p
  In SQL we use NULL as a placeholder for missing values. It has at least
  three different uses.

%ol
  %li
    To mark a value in a column as 'missing'.
  %li
    As placeholders in the result of an <a
    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Join_(SQL)#Outer_joins">outer join</a>
    where 'no match' are found between rows.
  %li
    As the result of arithmetic operations with one or more operands that are
    NULL. Here a NULL means 'unknown', unknown because information that is
    needed for evaluating the expression is missing.


%p
  If a value in a column is NULL, all you know is that it is missing. If you
  need to know why, you can store that information in a separate column.
  Another approach is to disallow NULLs and use an encoding that has distinct
  values for missing data. An example is the standard encoding for gender: <a
  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_5218">ISO 5218</a>.

%p
  The usage of NULL is one of the big controversies in SQL and relational
  systems. Some feels that it introduces unnecessary complexity, and the
  general advice seems to be to use NULLs only when there is no better option.

%h3 Reasons to avoid NULL

%ul
  %li
    NULL behaves differently from similar non-value markers in most
    programming languages.
  %li
    Some confuses NULL with the empty string, zero, or false.
  %li
    NULLs introduces 3-valued logic. That is, in addition to TRUE and FALSE
    you also have UNKNOWN, a source of many misunderstandings and errors in
    SQL statements.
  %li
    Many functions treat NULL in a special manner. To remember how NULL is
    handled by different functions is painful. Some examples: GROUP BY puts
    all rows with NULLs in the same group, thous treating them equal when in
    fact the equality is unknown. The SUM aggregate function ignores NULLs
    when summarizing the values of a column.
  %li
    Having columns that might be NULL in a table, typically introduces a
    penalty on performance.
  %li
    Mistakes are Easily made when dealing with ALL, ANY, IN, and EXISTS
    queries.
  %li
    Having many nullable columns in a table might indicate that the table is
    not properly <a
    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization">normalized</a>.

%h3 Reasons to use NULL

%ul
  %li
    It is a good idea to allow NULL when you need to mark a value as missing
    and there is no easy way handle missing values in any reasonable encoding
    for the column. Just be aware that you don't fall in any of the traps
    mentioned above.
