<h2>Selected topics on database management systems</h2>

<p>This is a series of articles that give a brief introduction to
several topics that come up when working with database systems. My
motivation is to shed light upon topics that I see many software
developers are ignorant of.

<p>The articles will hopefully give the reader enough information to
make her curious on the topic, and I will provide references as an aid
for further studies.

<h3>The articles so far (alphabetically)</h3>

<ul>
  <li><a href="MissingValuesInSQL.html">Missing values in SQL</a>
  <li><a href="NaturalVsSurrogatePrimaryKeys.html">Natural vs surrogate primary keys</a>
</ul>
