%p 
  To identify the different records in a relational table, we use a primary
  key. There are two kinds of primary keys with very different
  characteristics. A <a
  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_key"><em>natural key</em></a>
  uses a column or columns that are a natural part of a record, while a <a
  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrogate_key"><em>surrogate key</em></a>
  is added to the record and uses artificial data. When choosing your
  strategy, it is important to be aware of the advantages and disadvantages.

%p 
  The main advantage of a natural key is that it can be verified by comparing
  it with real world data. This is how users of the system typically will
  identify data.

%p 
  A surrogate key on the other hand has the advantage of being more robust to
  changes in how we identify the records in the real world. When the natural
  key changes (e.g. because of changes in business requirements), you don't
  have to change all your internal references to the record.

%p 
  It is also more efficient for the database system to use surrogate keys.
  This is true especially when joining on the primary keys, or if the system
  uses clustered primary key indexes.

%p 
  Since a surrogate key normally is internal to a system, it can't be used to
  reference entities in external systems.

%p
  There should always be maintained a natural key in a table even if a
  surrogate key is chosen as the primary. If not, the records will loose their
  connection to the real world. But be aware that the two keys might get out
  of sync without you noticing it.
