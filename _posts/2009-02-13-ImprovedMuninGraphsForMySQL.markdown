Inspired by [Xaprb's][1] [improved graphs for Cacti][2], I wrote a
plugin that creates similar graphs for [Munin][3]. The plugin is
included in the Munin project. For the newest version, go to
[my project page on github][4].


Some features:

- Data collected from MySQL is stored in shared memory, thus avoiding
  unnecessary server requests.
- Easy to create new graphs by adding a graph definition to the
  plugin.
