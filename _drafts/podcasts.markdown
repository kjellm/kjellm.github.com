Lately I have had less time and energy to read books (being a father
and all that), one of my old favorite pastimes. But this has led me to
discover the wonderful world of podcasts. The thing with podcasts is
that they are so easy to combine with other tasks like commuting or
doing cores, and also for relaxing. Here are some of my favorites:

- %a(href="http://rubyrogues.com") Ruby Rogues
- %a(href="http://thisdeveloperslife.com") This Developer's Life
- %a(href="http://rubyfreelancers.com") Ruby Freelancers
- %a(href="http://econtalk.org") EconTalk
- %a(href="http://www.radiolab.org") Radiolab
- %a(href="http://www.freakonomics.com/radio/") Freakonomics

Check them out!
