I believe Agile is as necessary today as it was when the manifesto was
first written. However, Agile has often been practiced in name only
and has sadly lost its original meaning.

For those who feel a bit lost, I suggest taking a step back and
looking at what Agile really means: to "embrace change." This leads me
to Extreme Programming (XP).

XP was one of the original Agile methodologies. What is especially
important about XP is that it describes what agility means for the
organization, the processes, and how teams build digital products. In
XP, all the elements are part of a system where each component
reinforces the others.

Therefore, I think XP is a great _starting point_. And I say starting
point because any fixed process is, by definition, not agile.

Is XP enough? In a sense, yes. When paired with the Agile principle of
continuous process improvement. But we have learned a lot since XP was
first introduced in 1999 (and revised in 2004), and the world has
changed. Over the last few years, I have explored what a modern
interpretation of XP could be and will share some of what I have
learned in a series of posts.

Perhaps most important to me is that I believe that the
highest-performing teams we have today are much more diverse than they
were back then, both in the backgrounds of people and in the skills
needed. FIXME My impression is that there is a lot of naivety about what
the potential is and what it takes to get there. For me, DevOps, Lean
UX, and research on psychological safety and team performance are some
of the main ideas that show the way.

I see having a culture that enables teams to flourish as a key
competitive advantage in product development. XP is based on the
values of simplicity, communication, feedback, courage, and
respect—values that are also central to psychological safety in teams
(except simplicity, which is important too but for different reasons).

By the way, building a digital product involves much more than
programming, so perhaps XP needs a new name. Maybe it can keep its
abbreviation: Extreme Product Development?
